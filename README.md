# About
LaTeX Template for Ph.D. thesis at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

# How To
*If* everything works out of the box, you should be able to simply compile the file `Dissertation.tex`.

However, there are **many** packages included and some of these are porbably redundant. There are also several config files, so setting the document up the first time might take some effort.
